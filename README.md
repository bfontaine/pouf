# pouf

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/pouf.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/pouf)

**pouf** plays random sounds from your command-line. It started as a shell
script for a joke, but itâ€™s now a Ruby gem.

It manages a set of sounds in a directory and use an alias for each sound, so
you can quickly play one without having to remember the filename.

Note: for now it works only on OS X.

## Install

```
gem install pouf
```

# Configuration

Set the environment variable `POUF_CMD` to whatever you want to use to play a 
sound. Feel free to use the program you like, but the command must be 
ready-to-use with a filename.

For instance, Ubuntu users may want to add `export POUF_CMD="mpg123 -q"` to 
their `.bashrc` file.

## Usage

From the command-line:

```
$ pouf add <alias> <filename>
$ pouf rm <alias>
$ pouf mv <alias1> <alias2>
$ pouf ls
$ pouf [play] <alias>
```
